We will be implementing the game board game, Othello. 
General game play rules were taken from 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi.


User GUI

Users will be presented with a green 8x8 uncheckered board, indexed A to H on 
the x-axis and 1 through 8 on the y-axis. The game contains 64 disk pieces of 
white color on one side and black on the other. To start with, four disks will 
be placed at the center of the board, two black disks placed on the 4E and 5D 
positions, and two white disks placed on 4D and 5E. Possible moves will be 
highlighted at each turn. A Reset button will be provided to reset the game, 
at any point of the game, and by any player. Scores will be displayed at the 
bottom of the board, keeping track of the number of disks of each color 
currently visible on the board. The names of the two players will be visible 
on the screen, with their names being highlighted, depending on whose turn it is. 

Player Actions

Users will be randomly assigned a color; the player with the black disks, 
starts the game. 
Players take turns placing disks of their color on the board. Disks can be 
moved diagonally, horizontally, and vertically. There are two possible ways a 
player can move. Either a player's disk jumps over a single disk of the opponent 
or the player's disk jumps over a sequence of adjacent disks of the opponent, 
lying in a straight line. Once jumped, the singular disk or the sequence of 
disks that was jumped over, will be flipped. If a player attempts an invalid move, 
a modal will signal the player to try again.

Winning 

A user wins when the game board contains the disk pieces that are mostly of 
their assigned color and there are no more possible moves left for the opponent 
to continue the game. At game end, a modal will signal the winning player and 
provide the option to start a new game.
